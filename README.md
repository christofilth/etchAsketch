# Project: Etch-A-Sketch
for The Odin Project's foundations course.

## Introduction
For this project, I am creating a browser based version of "something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch".

The full assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

### Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. 
Hand wrote code for createGrid function first. After setting up the files and creating links from the .html to .js and .css, added a container div to the html, this is where the grid will be created with JavaScript. In the .js file, wrote the function for createGrid, which uses a loop to create cells to fill the grid. Changed container display to flex box, and cell size is calculated using whatever number is entered into column.
